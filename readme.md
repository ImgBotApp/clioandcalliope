After cloning the repo, run `npm install` or `yarn` to install all the npm packages.

If you don't already have [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#getting-started) installed on your system, add it with `npm install --global gulp-cli`.

Now you can run the following tasks:

- `gulp watch` runs a local server and serves up **app/index.html** at http://localhost:3000. It also automatically reloads when any files are changed.
- `gulp build` prepares production-ready build in a **build/** folder. Open **build/index.html** in your browser to see the production code.
